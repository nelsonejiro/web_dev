    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      At <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">Taste of the World</span>, we believe food is more than just a meal — it’s a memory, a language, a bridge between cultures.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Born out of passion for authenticity and diversity, our kitchen brings together native chefs from different corners of the globe. Each of our seven signature dishes is a love letter to tradition — hand-crafted with heritage, served with pride.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
      Whether it’s the slow-roasted <span class="italic">Schweinshaxe</span> of Bavaria, the fiery Ayamase from Yoruba lands, or the fragrant dumplings of Sichuan — every bite invites you into a world of stories and flavors.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-green-700 font-medium mt-6 italic">
      “One kitchen. Seven cultures. A shared table.”
